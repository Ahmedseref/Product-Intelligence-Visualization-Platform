Intelligent Technical Dashboard & Visualization System
With Multi-Supplier Intelligence & Comparison Layer

(Construction Chemicals System Intelligence Platform)

🎯 Objective

Redesign the dashboard and analytics engine to deliver:

Technical product intelligence

System engineering insights

Taxonomy analytics

Layer & structure analysis

Product utilization intelligence

Multi-supplier benchmarking

Competitive system comparison

All visualizations must use:

👉 Nivo Visualization Library
👉 Nivo Heatmap for all comparison matrices

🧱 Core Data Model Expansion
New Core Entity — Supplier

Each entity must include supplier relationships:

Product

product_id

supplier_id (or multiple suppliers)

supplier_product_code

supplier_grade

supplier_region

equivalent_products[]

System

system_id

system_name

sector

suppliers_supported[]

default_supplier

system_variant_by_supplier[]

Layer

layer_id

layer_type

allowed_suppliers[]

supplier_default_products[]
