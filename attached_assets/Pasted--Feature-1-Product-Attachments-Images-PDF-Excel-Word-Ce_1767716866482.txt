✅ Feature 1
Product Attachments (Images, PDF, Excel, Word, Certificates)

You want each product to support:

Images

Technical documents (TDS, MSDS)

Certificates

Any file type

This is absolutely standard in enterprise product systems.

1️⃣ Concept: Product Attachments

Instead of “images only”, introduce a generic attachment system.

Attachment Types

Image (jpg, png, webp)

PDF (TDS, MSDS)

Excel (pricing sheets)

Word (spec sheets)

Any other file

2️⃣ Data Model Extension
🔹 Attachment Entity
Attachment {
  id: string;                 // A-0001
  productId: string;          // SupplierProduct ID
  name: string;               // MSDS_Marble.pdf
  type: "image" | "pdf" | "excel" | "word" | "other";
  mimeType: string;           // application/pdf
  size: number;               // bytes
  storageKey: string;         // local reference
  uploadedAt: Date;
}

🔹 SupplierProduct (Extended)
SupplierProduct {
  ...
  attachments: Attachment[];
}

3️⃣ UI / UX – Add Product Tab
📌 New Section: Product Files

Inside Add Product / Edit Product

UI Components

📎 “Upload Files” button

Drag & Drop area

File type icons

File preview (image thumbnails)

File list with:

Name

Type

Size

Delete action

📂 Example File Grouping (Optional)

You can visually group files:

📁 Technical Documents
   - TDS_Marble.pdf
   - MSDS_Marble.pdf

📁 Certificates
   - ISO_9001.pdf
   - CE_Certificate.pdf

📁 Images
   - marble_tile.jpg


(This can be UI-only grouping — storage stays flat.)

4️⃣ File Storage Strategy (No Backend Required)

Since you want data to persist after tab close, here are the realistic options:

✅ Option A — IndexedDB (Recommended)

✔ Supports large files
✔ Binary storage
✔ Persistent

Why LocalStorage is NOT enough

Size limit (~5MB)

No binary support

Storage Flow

User uploads file

File stored in IndexedDB

Metadata saved with product

File retrievable after reload

✔ Works offline
✔ No server needed
✔ Industry-correct choice

5️⃣ Security / Validation

Max file size (configurable)

Allowed file types

Virus scan (only if backend added later)
