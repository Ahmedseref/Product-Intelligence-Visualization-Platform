Objective
Build a global floating note system inside my web application. The notes must be accessible across all pages, routes, and tabs of the app, remaining available regardless of navigation.

Core Requirements
1. Global Floating Note Widget

A note widget that:

Floats above all app content

Is visible and accessible on every page and tab

Persists during route changes (SPA navigation)

Default position: bottom-right corner

Must not interfere with core app interactions

2. Draggable Behavior

The widget must:

Be draggable anywhere on the screen

Remember its last position

Dragging should feel smooth and responsive

3. Minimize & Expand

The widget must include:

Minimize button → collapses into a compact icon/bar

Expand button → restores the full notes panel

Minimized state:

Takes minimal screen space

Remains draggable and clickable

Is visible across all pages

4. Note Management

Users must be able to:

Add new notes

Edit notes inline

Delete notes

Use checklist functionality

Each note must include:

Text content

Checkbox (completed / not completed)

Edit action

Delete action

5. Checklist Behavior

Completed notes:

Are visually distinct (e.g., strikethrough, faded)

Users can toggle completion on and off

6. Global Persistence

Notes must persist:

Across all app pages and tabs

After page refresh

Use localStorage (or IndexedDB if preferred)

Store:

Notes content

Completion status

Widget position

Minimized / expanded state

7. Multi-Tab Sync (Important)

Changes in one browser tab must:

Reflect automatically in other open tabs

Use storage events or equivalent sync logic

UI / UX Guidelines

Minimal, modern UI

Non-blocking overlay

Smooth animations for:

Dragging

Adding/editing notes

Minimizing / expanding

Responsive for desktop and tablet

Technical Constraints

Implement using vanilla JavaScript or React

No heavy external libraries

Modular architecture:

FloatingWidget component

NotesManager

StorageService

Widget should mount at a global/root level so it persists across routes

Deliverables

Fully functional global floating note system

Well-commented, maintainable code

Easy to extend later with:

Tags

Search

Reminders

Export / import notes

Optional Enhancements

Keyboard shortcut to toggle widget visibility

Auto-save while typing

Pin important notes to top
